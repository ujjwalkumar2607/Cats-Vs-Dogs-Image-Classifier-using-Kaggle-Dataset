# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Image-Classifier-using-Kaggle-Dataset
Use Google Colaboratory for enhanced experience and inorder to test your picture of a cat or a dog.
The model was trained using 25,000 images from the Kaggle dataset.
The data was preprocessed by splitting them into training and testing set with 90% data in train set and 10% data on the test se.
The model architecture includes 3 sets of convolutional layers and pooling layers.
The optimizer used was "RMS Propagation" with the binary crossentropy loss function.
The model showed an accuracy of approximately 80% on the training set and 81% on the validation set.
Data Augmentation techniques were used by passing arguments in the ImageDataGenerator class to avoid overfitting on the training set.
